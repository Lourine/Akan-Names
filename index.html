      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born.Most people do know when their birthdays are, but some might not know what day of the week they were born. Luckily for us, there are ways to calculate the day of the week from a specific date. This website will take your birthday and calculate the day of the week you were born and then depending on your  gender it  outputs your Akan Name.</p>
